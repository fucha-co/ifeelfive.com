      			<p><strong>Hi Five At Heart, I&rsquo;m Lane (#waving)</strong>.</p>

<p>I love getting things done, I don&rsquo;t do normal marketing guff, I can work and learn independently, I&rsquo;m fit, fun, happy, heathly, comfortable, conscious, and personalble. Plus: bikes are in my blood&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve ridden many 300+km days and I once rode 3,300km solo in 21 days. So I know exactly what it&rsquo;s like to feel fucked after a bike ride and frustrated by things that should be simplier; by things that could be better. I feel the freedom of the ride and the frustrations on the other side.
<br><br>
I already feel five at heart. And I feel Five At Heart too.
<br><br>
I learned long ago that I&rsquo;m at my most creative when I am feeling FAH, so when I saw your job ad on SEEK on Sunday morning I left home and went for a long run. Somewhere on the single trails of the Yarra Bend along the Merri I decided I wanted you to feel me; I wanted you to see my character, determination, and desire to work with you. And I FEEL FIVE was born in my mind&hellip; and live online less than a day later.</p>

<p>Also: real creatives don&rsquo;t attach resumes&hellip;</p>

    <cite>This is me before... (on the front; dragging Robbie (McEwen's) arse across to the 2 man break up the road that he somehow missed. I was riding for him at the Noosa Crit and rode him across and dropped him off at the back of the break. This 210bpm effort ended my race and how Robbie didn't win from here I have no idea...)</cite>

    <cite>This is me now... (Standing by my late-20's statement that a good mullet never grows old and proudly wearing one of my SAYSO sweaters. *SAYSO is small social brand I plan to launch later this year.)</cite>

    <cite>And this is my current ride... (a Limited Edition CHTP3 Brompton; the S6E of course. Never have I felt so alive and so Five as I do riding Melbourne's streets on this little love. Also: we've never been beaten off the lights by another bike or ridden off the wheel for that matter. Though both might be only a matter of time... #laughing)</cite>

<p><strong>Me Briefly</strong>: I&rsquo;m a complete digital creative suite wrapped in a single caring, sharing soul. &lsquo;For good&rsquo; fuels my heart and being a great writer, coder, and communicator is just the start — my love, passion, compassion, and people skills are greater again.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>Me Broadly</strong>: I&rsquo;m a brilliant writer, communicator, and conceptualist with bonus website coding and management skills, strong social media nous, advanced analytical and optimisation skills (including website performance, mobile web performance, Google Analytics, and more), email marketing and e-commerce experience, plus a photographic eye and Photoshop skills. Furthermore I&rsquo;m an expert in minimising online operating costs and maximising online operating returns. But even greater than my professional skills are my personal skills&hellip; and I don&rsquo;t use adverbs lightly.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>In the next few pages</strong> you&rsquo;ll find my resume, referees, and learn more about me. Ultimately I hope we meet for a brew so I can learn more about you and we can discuss me feeling Five At Heart right beside you.</p>
