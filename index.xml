      <description>Hi Five At Heart, I&amp;rsquo;m Lane (#waving).
I love getting things done, I don&amp;rsquo;t do normal marketing guff, I can work and learn independently, I&amp;rsquo;m fit, fun, happy, heathly, comfortable, conscious, and personalble. Plus: bikes are in my blood&amp;hellip;
I&amp;rsquo;ve ridden many 300+km days and I once rode 3,300km solo in 21 days. So I know exactly what it&amp;rsquo;s like to feel fucked after a bike ride and frustrated by things that should be simplier; by things that could be better.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m a haloumi whore and affogato addict who dreams of liberation and llama farming. I’ll love you forever if you’ll just read me aloud DFW’s Infinite Jest… a book I’ve owned forever but never read. If you’re not down for David can we fly to Tokyo, suck down saké, and sing karaoke until sunrise? Music and art are the way to my heart when cheese and coffee aren&amp;rsquo;t appropriate.</description>

      <description>Writing&amp;rsquo;s my greatest love but not my only skill — I have a bunch of others that gift me great insight into much bigger brand and business puzzles. Such skills allow me to see how different pieces compliment each other, and why, sometimes, compromises must be made.

      <description>I also love to run and strum (the ukulele). They&amp;rsquo;re both new loves in my life and I can&amp;rsquo;t get enough of them. I&amp;rsquo;ve always found physical challenge as rewarding as the creative kind and pushing my mind and body ultimately brings out the best in both. I&amp;rsquo;m grateful to be happy, healthy, and humble and being mindful, minimal, and meanginful plays a large role in my life too. I run regularly, drink rarely, drug never, fast intermittently, and Wim Hof daily.</description>

      <description>I love photography. PHACES (www.phac.es) is a personal project of mine where the focus appears to be on those in front of the lens while the real focus is always behind it&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Thanks for reading I FEEL FIVE. I was excited to see your job advertised and I wanted you to see my character, determination, and desire to work with you. I hope it has shined through.
I really do — feel five and feel you — and I really am creative (I already have Five At Heart creative ideas bouncing around in my brain). I&amp;rsquo;m Melbourne-based, available immediately, and hope to hear from you.</description>
